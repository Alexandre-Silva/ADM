# Introduction
The core idea of ADM is the setup.sh file were all information about one *thing*
is located. This *thing* can be any unit of configuration. For example, a
configuration of emacs can have several .el (i.e. configuration) files, shell
aliases for launching it, the necessary packages to install emacs and other
tools such as jedi or JSLint. Additionally, some specific text font could be
used which is contained in some other setup.sh. To express all this, one would
only need to create a setup.sh similar to the example below.

```bash
# emacs.setup.sh
depends=( path/to/font.setup.sh )
packages=( apt:emacs apt:python-jedi )
links=( ~/dotfiles/emacs.el ~/.emacs.el )
st_rc() {
  alias ec='emacs'            # launch GUI
  alias et='emacs --terminal' # launch in terminal
}
```

// single tool to do it

// all bash

After some research into other tools to perform dotfile management, I found that
these topically only handle soft-link management. While in the previous example
**all** configurations are located in a single place.

# Quick-Start

# Installation
1a - Download and save the repository.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alexandre-Silva/ADM.git
```
1b - Or as submodule inside a git repository.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Alexandre-Silva/ADM.git
```
Then, to update other machines.
```bash
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

2 - Add the following to your .profile or .zprofile
```bash
export ADM=/path/to/ADM
function adm() { source $ADM/adm.sh "$@" }
```

Note that 'adm.sh' is sourced and not executed in a sub-shell. This is necessary since otherwise most configurations (aliases, environment variables, functions, etc) would not be exported to the current shell.

# Requirements
ADM is designed to work on both Bash and ZSH. The required are, respectively:

- Bash: version 4.0.0 or higher (required for associative arrays)
- ZSH: any version


# Usage

## adm tool
```bash
adm install
```
To install all *.config.sh in the directory and sub-directories.


## *.setup.sh

This files are all source into the current shell. Therefore, it's a good idea to
use some helper functions to prevent polluting the shell's environment.
TODO: put example

### depends
This var should contain a list of other setup.sh which must be processed. The
dependencies must be specified using absolute paths. Note that the ADM_DIR
helper var can be, well, helpful.

### packages
[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1654/)

### links
TODO

### install()
If a function named *install* is present it's when the adm command of the same is called.

### st_profile(), st_rc()
Functions named *st\_profile*, and *st\_rc* are executed when the adm commands profile and rc, respectively.

### Helpers
When writing the setup.sh, there are a few quality of life features that can be used.

* *ADM\_DIR*: is a var containing the absolute path to the directory which contains the setup.sh being executed.
* *ADM\_FILE*: Like *ADM\_DIR* but for the setup.sh itself.

## Configurations

### Environment vars

- ADM\_INSTALL\_DIR: The folder in which setup.sh files are given to create
  temporary files and alike. Note that each setup file is given its own directory,
  e.g. foo.setup.sh uses $ADM\_INSTALL\_DIR/foo/

# Important notes
The prefix ```'adm_*'``` is reserved for internal ADM functions. However you will note that no function is exported to the shell environment even though $ADM/adm.sh is sourced. This is because internally, ADM dynamically unsets *all* functions with that prefix.
