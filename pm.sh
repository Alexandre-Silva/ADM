# This files handles the loading and use of various package manager wrappers in
# pm.d directory.
#
# The initialization works by sourcing every .sh in pm.d. Each file there should
# register one or more prefixed to a function defined in the file. That function
# is the wrapper to the package manager in question.
#
# Once all package mangers are loaded adm_pm_install (and family) can be called
# to perform operations on packages using the wrappers.
